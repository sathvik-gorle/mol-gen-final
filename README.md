## Abstract
Cleaning up PCB‑contaminated soil usually means mixing in some kind of black carbon. That carbon soaks up the pollutant, but it also gives Paraburkholderia xenovorans LB400, a bacterium that can  digest PCBs, a place to live. This analysis investigates whether the kind of black‑carbon surface matters at the gene‑expression level. Using the public RNA‑seq dataset GSE246487, I compared LB400 cells that were floating freely with cells attached to 3 things: 1. small corn‑kernel biochar, (2: large corn‑kernel biochar, and 3: granular activated carbon (GAC). Out of about nine‑thousand genes, 744 flipped just from surface attachment and nearly 2000 flipped when the GAC was swapped for the finer corn biochar. PCB‑breaking genes (bphA1–4) always went up, but only the biochars cranked up CO₂‑fixing genes (cbbL/S, RuBisCO). Overall, corn biochar doesn’t just hold onto PCBs, but it flips LB400 into a gene program that breaks them down faster than GAC can.
